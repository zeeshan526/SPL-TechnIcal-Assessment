# Dynamic Programming Problems:

## Problem 1: Solve Fibonnaci Problem using Memoization.

Fibonnaci Formula: f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) if n>2 && f(1) = 1, f(2)=1
This problem is self descriptive.
You should be able to explain the memoization in comments.


	The first step will be to write the recursive code. In the program below, a program related to recursion where only one parameter changes its value has been shown. Since only one parameter is non-constant, this method is known as 1-D memoization. E.g., the Fibonacci series problem to find the N-th term in the Fibonacci series.
