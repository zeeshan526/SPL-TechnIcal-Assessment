# Hashmaps Problems:

## Problem 1: Shared SubStrings between Two Strings

    strings share a substring between each other.

    Example:

        'abcd' and 'cde' returns 1;
        'abc' and 'xyz' returns 0;

## Problem 2: Comparsion Of Two Maps

    Given two maps return a boolean indicating the equailty of two maps.

    Note: the order of the keys do not matter

    Example:

        Hashmap x  = {a:1,b:2,c:3}, Hashmap b={c:3,b:2,a:1} returns 1;

        Hashmap x'  = {a:1,b:2,d:3}, Hashmap b={x:3,c:2,a:1} returns 0;

    Questions:

        Can we use this method to return how many elements match between two maps?
